%h3 Hello!

  %p This is an attempt in bringing a great manga reading experience to the people who own a tablet device like an iPad (Android support will come soon). We think the tablet-sized & touch-enabled devices are a great way to rediscover the pleasure to read, especially mangas. Please, consider the work done by mangakas and buy the real mangas in the OriginalPaperFormatâ„¢ as soon as they are available in your country.

  / TODO: Visit my profile and see my favorities:

%h3 How does it works
.readbox
  %p MangaPad is formed by three parts. A Viewer, an #{link_to "Index", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(database)"} and a #{link_to "Proxy", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern"}. The Viewer is in javascript and it's the part that interfaces directly to your device thanks to html5 and other APIs to achieve animations, touch interaction, etc.
  /
    %p The viewer's code is open source and published here:
    %p= link_to "github.com/makevoid/mangapad_viewer", "http://github.com/makevoid/mangapad_viewer"
  %p The Index knows where the actual images are (through a link). It serves the images through the proxy with a link http://mangapad.org/img/http://IMAGE_URL.


%h3 Important
.readbox
  %p If you want to block mangapad from proxying your contents there are some simple ways.
  %ul.simple_ways
    %li drop us an email, we will add your domain(s) to the blacklist, and your content will not be proxied
    %li block the ip 213.175.207.190 (note: there is a [remote] possibility that doing that you will block other services connected that server)
