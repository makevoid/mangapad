Hi guys, 

unfortunately apple seems not accepting native manga applications for the iPad, but (she) can't do anything about webapps running in Safari. MangaPad.org can be a solution. It contains a lot of free manga scans taken from the interweb. If you want to try reading some mangas with your iPad go to http://mangapad.org and enjoy this great way to read them. We tried to use html5 technologies to let you achieve almost the same experience you could get on a native app. The application is still in beta, it's not polished yet but we released this early so that you can use it and we can make it better.
Please also send us some feedback, report some bugs or give us your ideas about features that you would like to see.
